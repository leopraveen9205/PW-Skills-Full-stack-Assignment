    "\n",
    "A11: To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job, we can use the following formula for the confidence interval for a population proportion:\n",
    "Confidence Interval = p̂ ± Z * √(p̂(1 - p̂) /  n)\n",
    "Where:      \n",
    "- p̂ is the sample proportion (0.65)\n",
    "- Z is the critical value for the desired confidence level (for 95% confidence, Z ≈ 1.96)\n",
    "- n is the sample size (500)    \n",
    "First, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) of the proportion:\n",
    "SE = √(p̂(1 - p̂) / n)        \n",
    "    = √(0.65 * (1 - 0.65) / 500)     \n",
    "    = √(0.65 * 0.35 / 500)     \n",
    "    = √(0.2275 / 500)     \n",
    "    = √0.000455     \n",
    "    ≈ 0.0213    \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):\n",
    "ME = Z * SE \n",
    "    = 1.96 * 0.0213     \n",
    "    ≈ 0.0417      \n",

    "                   ≈ (0.6083, 0.6917)   \n",
    "Therefore, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job falls within the interval (0.6083, 0.6917). This means that if we were to take many samples and calculate the confidence interval for each, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population proportion of job satisfaction.    \n",
