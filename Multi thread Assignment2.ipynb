    "What is Multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a technique that allows a program to run multiple processes simultaneously, each process having its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables true parallelism because each process runs independently on different CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in module for this called the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Multiprocessing Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is especially useful for CPU-bound tasks, i.e., tasks that require heavy computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bypasses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythons GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing avoids this by creating separate processes—each with its own interpreter and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. True Parallel Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks run simultaneously on multiple CPU cores, increasing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improves Speed for Heavy Computations\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Image/video processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning model training\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical computations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Better Utilization of Multi-core CPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern systems have many cores; multiprocessing ensures all are used efficiently.\n",
