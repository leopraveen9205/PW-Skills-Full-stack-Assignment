    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",
    "can they be mitigated?\n",
    "A1: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and details that do not generalize to new, unseen data. This results in high accuracy on the training set but poor performance on the test set. Consequences of overfitting include reduced model generalization and increased variance. To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as cross-validation, pruning, regularization (L1/L2), dropout (in neural networks), and using simpler models can be employed.\n",

    "Q2: What is the bias-variance tradeoff? How does it relate to model complexity?\n",
    "A2: The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the  balance between two sources of error that affect model performance: bias and variance. Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model, leading to underfitting. Variance refers to the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting. As model complexity increases, bias tends to decrease while variance tends to increase. The goal is to find an optimal balance where both bias and variance are minimized, resulting in better generalization to unseen data.   \n",

    "Q3: Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Provide examples of algorithms used in each type.\n",
    "A3: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with a corresponding output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on this labeled data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset,\n",

    "Q4: What are some common evaluation metrics for classification and regression tasks? How do you choose the appropriate metric for a given problem?\n",
    "A4: Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). For regression tasks, common metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. The choice of metric depends on the specific problem and its requirements. For instance, in imbalanced classification problems, precision and recall may be more informative than accuracy. In regression tasks where outliers are a concern, MAE might be preferred over MSE due to its robustness to extreme values.       \n",

High variance models, such as deep neural networks with excessive layers or decision trees without pruning, perform well on training data but poorly on test data due to their tendency to memorize noise in the training set.
