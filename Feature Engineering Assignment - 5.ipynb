    "\n",
    "A1. Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical format, but they serve different purposes based on the nature of the data.\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding: This technique is used for categorical variables that have a meaningful order or ranking among the categories. In Ordinal Encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer based on its order. For example, consider a variable \"Size\" with categories \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\". Using Ordinal Encoding, we might assign \"Small\" = 1, \"Medium\" = 2, and \"Large\" = 3. This encoding reflects the inherent order of the sizes.\n",
    "- Label Encoding: This technique is used for categorical variables that do not have any intrinsic order or ranking among the categories. In Label Encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer without any consideration of order. For example, consider a variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Green\". Using Label Encoding, we might assign \"Red\" = 0, \"Blue\" = 1, and \"Green\" = 2. Here, the numbers do not imply any order or ranking among the colors.\n",

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",

    "\n",
    "A2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between the categories and the target variable in a supervised learning context. The idea is to replace each category with a numerical value that reflects the average (or another statistic) of the target variable for that category. This method helps to capture the predictive power of the categorical variable with respect to the target.\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset where we want to predict whether a customer will buy a product (target variable: \"Buy\" with values 0 for No and 1 for Yes) based on the \"City\" they live in. We can calculate the mean of the target variable for each city:\n",
    "- City A: 0.2 (20% of customers buy)\n",
    "- City B: 0.5 (50% of customers buy)\n",
    "- City C: 0.8 (80% of customers buy)\n",
    "Using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, we would replace the \"City\" categories with these mean values:\n",
    "- City A = 0.2\n",
    "- City B = 0.5\n",
    "- City C = 0.8\n",
    "This encoding captures the relationship between the \"City\" and the likelihood of a customer buying the product, which can be useful for machine learning models.    \n",
    "You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project when dealing with high-cardinality categorical variables that have a significant impact on the target variable, as it can help improve model performance by providing more informative features.\n",

    "A3. Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two random variables change together. It quantifies the direction of the linear relationship between the variables. If the covariance is positive, it means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. Conversely, if the covariance is negative, it indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. A covariance of zero suggests that there is no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps to understand the relationships between different variables, which can inform decisions in various fields such as finance, economics, and machine learning. For example, in portfolio management, understanding the covariance between asset returns can help in diversifying investments to minimize risk. Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
