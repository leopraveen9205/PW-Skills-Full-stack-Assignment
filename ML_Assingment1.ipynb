    "2. Density-Based Methods:\n",
    "    Techniques like Local Outlier Factor (LOF) or Isolation Forest analyze the density of data points. Anomalies are detected as points in low-density regions compared to their neighbors.\n",
    "3. Autoencoders:\n",
    "    Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct input data. Anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction error; data points with high errors are considered anomalies. \n",
    "4. Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "    Methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the data's dimensionality, making it easier to identify outliers that deviate significantly from the main data distribution. \n",
