    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. \n",
    "In data science, it is particularly useful for transforming categorical variables into a numerical format that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "Many algorithms require numerical input, so encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding are commonly used to convert categorical data into a suitable format. \n",

    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "Nominal encoding, also known as one-hot encoding, is a technique used to convert categorical variables into a binary format. \n",
    "Each category is represented by a separate binary column, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of that category and 0 indicates its absence. \n",
    "For example, consider a dataset containing information about different fruits with a categorical variable \"Fruit Type\" that includes categories such as \"Apple,\" \"Banana,\" and \"Orange.\" \n",
    "Using nominal encoding, we would create three new binary columns: \"Is_Apple,\" \"Is_Banana,\" and \"Is_Orange.\" If a particular row represents an apple, the values would be [1, 0, 0]; for a banana, it would be [0, 1, 0]; and for an orange, it would be [0, 0, 1]. \n",

    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is often preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where the categorical variable has a large number of unique categories, leading to a high-dimensional feature space when using one-hot encoding. \n",
    "This can result in increased computational complexity and memory usage, as well as the risk of overfitting in machine learning models.\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset containing information about different countries, where the categorical variable \"Country\" has over 200 unique categories.\n",
    "Using one-hot encoding would create over 200 binary columns, which can be inefficient and may lead to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" \n",
    "In such cases, nominal encoding techniques like target encoding or frequency encoding can be more effective. \n",
    "Target encoding replaces each category with the mean of the target variable for that category, while frequency encoding replaces each category with its frequency in the dataset. \n",
    "These methods reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while still capturing important information about the categorical variable.\n",

    "Explain why you made this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values, I would use one-hot encoding to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "One-hot encoding is appropriate in this case because the number of unique categories is relatively small, which means that the resulting feature space will not be excessively high-dimensional. \n",
    "This technique creates a separate binary column for each category, allowing machine learning algorithms to process the categorical data effectively without assuming any ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "Additionally, one-hot encoding helps to prevent the introduction of bias that can occur with other encoding techniques, such as label encoding, which may imply an unintended order among the categories.   \n",
