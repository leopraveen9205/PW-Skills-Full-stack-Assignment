    "\n",
    "A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of each possible outcome for a discrete random variable. It assigns a probability to each specific value that the random variable can take.\n",
    "For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF for the outcome of rolling the die would assign a probability of 1/6 to each of the outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), since each outcome is equally likely.\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF), on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables. It describes the relative likelihood of the random variable taking on a specific value within a continuous range. \n",
    "The PDF does not give probabilities directly; instead, the probability of the variable falling within a certain interval is found by calculating the area under the curve of the PDF over that interval.\n",

    "A Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
    "It is applicable to both discrete and continuous random variables. The CDF is obtained by integrating the Probability Density Function (PDF) for continuous variables or summing the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for discrete variables.\n",
    "For example, consider a discrete random variable representing the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die. The CDF for this variable would give the probability that the outcome is less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
    "For instance, the CDF value at 3 would be the sum of the probabilities of rolling a 1, 2, or 3, which is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2.\n",
